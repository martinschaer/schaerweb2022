JavaScript is a high-level interpreted programming language.
High-level means it&rsquo;s convinient for humans, at the expense of performance (and security). An interpreted language differs from a compiled program, in the fact that it requires and intermediary to interpret it, while a compiled program speaks the language of the audience.

Golang is my go-to for microservices that are not that performance dependant. But Rust is the right tool for performance, when finding unique skills is not a problem.</p><p>With Rust, I decided to try <a href=https://github.com/asny/three-d>three-d</a> over <a href=https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d>kiss3d</a> just because it has a backer that relies on that technology. So far, it has been a very straighforward experience comming from Three.js –appart from the Rust learning curve which is unprecedented.</p></main></article></div></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(function(e,t,n,s,o,i,a){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=o,e[o]=e[o]||function(){(e[o].q=e[o].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[o].l=1*new Date,i=t.createElement(n),a=t.getElementsByTagName(n)[0],i.async=1,i.src=s,a.parentNode.insertBefore(i,a)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15165899-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script></body></html>
