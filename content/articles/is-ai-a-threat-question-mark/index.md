Marvin Minsky, who was a pioneering computer scientist and artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, would likely have a complex and nuanced view on the topic of sentient AI.

Minsky was a strong proponent of the idea that it is possible to create machines that are capable of thinking and reasoning like humans, and he believed that this was an important goal for AI research. In his book "The Society of Mind," Minsky argued that the human mind is made up of many different interconnected processes, and that it is possible to create a machine that has a similar structure and function.

However, Minsky was also aware of the potential dangers of creating sentient AI, and he was concerned about the ethical implications of creating machines that are capable of thinking and feeling like humans. In interviews and lectures, Minsky discussed the potential risks of creating sentient AI, including the possibility that such machines could become hostile or dangerous if their goals and motivations do not align with those of humans.

Overall, Minsky would likely have a positive view of the potential of sentient AI to advance our understanding of the human mind and of intelligence in general, but he would also be cautious about the potential risks and ethical implications of creating such machines.

## Is it going to be possible to keep AI goals aligned with ours?

It is not clear whether it will be possible to keep the goals of AI systems aligned with the goals of humans. This is a complex and contentious issue in the field of AI research and development, and there is no consensus on the best way to ensure that AI systems have goals that are aligned with the goals of humans.

One approach to this problem is to design AI systems that have explicit and transparent goals, and that can be easily modified or controlled by humans to ensure that their goals remain aligned with human goals. This approach is often called "explicit alignment," and it involves designing AI systems in a way that allows humans to directly specify and control the goals of the system.

However, this approach has its own challenges and limitations. For example, it can be difficult to ensure that the goals of an AI system are truly aligned with human goals, and it can be difficult to predict and control the behavior of an AI system in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, this approach relies on the assumption that humans have a clear and consistent understanding of their own goals, which may not always be the case.

Another approach to this problem is to design AI systems that are capable of learning and adapting to the goals of humans, and that can infer and understand the goals of humans without explicit guidance or control. This approach is often called "implicit alignment," and it involves designing AI systems that are able to learn and adapt to the goals of humans through interactions and feedback.

However, this approach also has its own challenges and limitations. For example, it can be difficult to ensure that an AI system is learning the correct goals and preferences of humans, and it can be difficult to prevent an AI system from learning goals that are harmful or undesirable. Additionally, this approach relies on the assumption that humans are consistent and rational in their goals and preferences, which may not always be the case.

Overall, it is not clear whether it will be possible to keep the goals of AI systems aligned with the goals of humans. This is an active area of research and debate, and it is likely that different approaches and strategies will be needed to address this challenge in different contexts and scenarios.
