## 3D Model

Progress:

{{< figure src="001.png" title="First 3D model iteration" >}}
{{< figure src="002.png" title="Second 3D model iteration" >}}
{{< figure src="003.png" title="Third 3D model iteration" >}}

At this point the mesh was a mess. I wanted to have a cleaner mesh, because that would make it easier to adjust.

So I turned to YouTube and found this amazing tutorial:

Then started from scratch and in no time I made this (also I went for a *zero-sidepods* look like the Mercedes team):

{{< figure src="004.png" title="Fourth 3D model iteration" >}}
{{< figure src="005.png" title="Fifth 3D model iteration" >}}

## F1 VR Room

I used the F1 model to decorate my F1 VR Room: [F1 VR Room](/f1)
