## Me

I'm a computer science engineer specialized in full-stack web development and architecture design for cloud solutions with 12+ years of experience managing teams. I'm a former entrepreneur and founded a successful advertising agency, which gave me my background in web design, UX, and marketing.

Last 3 years, I have been working on transforming AI experiments into real life products at Accenture.

In my personal time, I have been experimenting with computer graphics, and robotics, with the goal of combining that with my background in cloud technologies and AI integrations.

Since I was very young, I’ve been passionate about cars, inventing, and coding. I became a computer engineer to harness the power behind coding – the greatest tool for creativity and innovation – and, during my free time, I’m a karting and eSports driver. I’ve competed in the Costa Rica Karting Championship in 2018 and the Costa Rica Virtual Racing Championship in 2020.

I believe if I could go back in time, young Martin would be proud of the person I’ve become and the fact that I’ve always done what I truly loved.

This is my personal website. You'll find here what I care to document and share. It’s also my playground to test web technologies.

## Favorite tools:

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for coding and writing (I like markdown better than docx)
- lunarvim
- lazygit
- [Excalidraw](excalidraw.com/) as a virtual whiteboard. Not for collaborative work. Useful for drafting diagrams, instead of going with UML at first.
- [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) for editing markdown if you don't have your IDE with markdown preview and mermaid extensions.
- mermaid
- PlantUML
