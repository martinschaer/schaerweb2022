## Me

I'm a computer science engineer specialized in full-stack web development and architecture design for cloud solutions with 12+ years of experience managing teams. I'm a former entrepreneur and founded a successful advertising agency, which gave me my background in web design, UX, and marketing.

Last 3 years, I have been working on transforming AI experiments into real life products at Accenture.

<!-- In my personal time, I have been experimenting with computer graphics, and robotics, with the goal of combining that with my background in cloud technologies and AI integrations. -->

<!-- Since I was very young, I’ve been passionate about cars, inventing, and coding. I became a computer engineer to harness the power behind coding – the greatest tool for creativity and innovation – and, during my free time, I’m a karting and eSports driver. I’ve competed in the Costa Rica Karting Championship in 2018 and the Costa Rica Virtual Racing Championship in 2020. -->

<!-- I believe if I could go back in time, young Martin would be proud of the person I’ve become and the fact that I’ve always done what I truly loved. -->

<!-- This is my personal website. You'll find here what I care to document and share. It’s also my playground to test web technologies. -->

On my free time, I like to [code](/tags/dev), [build and fly FPV planes and drones](/tags/fpv), do [3D modelling and rendering](/tags/3d), and [race in eSports](https://youtu.be/7ru7-QaSaKY).
