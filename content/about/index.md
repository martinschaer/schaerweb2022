This is my personal website. You'll find here what I care to document and share. Itâ€™s also my playground to test web technologies.

My social links:

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinschaer/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/martinco06" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/martinschaer/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/martinschaer/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

My favorite tools:

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for coding and writing (I like markdown better than docx)
- [Excalidraw](excalidraw.com/) as a virtual whiteboard. Not for collaborative work. Useful for drafting diagrams, instead of going with UML at first.
- [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) for editing markdown if you don't have your IDE with markdown preview and mermaid extensions.
